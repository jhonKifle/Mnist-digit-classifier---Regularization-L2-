# Mnist-digit-classifier---Regularization-L2-
A comparison of accuracy for Mnist digit classifier with  Regularization. 

As showns in above, the classification accuracy on the validation data is up, from 81.42 percent when running unregularized, to 93.3 percent. From this we can understand that regularization act as a way to reduce overfitting and to increase classification accuracies.
Selecting the value for the L2 regularization parameter requires balancing between preventing overfitting and maintaining model performance. The optimal value often depends on the problem, dataset, and model type.
